## What is Bid For Power?

Bid For Power (BFP) is a quake 3 total conversion. We have taken
quake 3 and used it to create a new game. In order to play BFP, you
will need the full retail version of Quake 3 Arena by ID Software, but
once you have that installed, our game is a free downloadable add-on.   
Bid For Power will run on any windows, linux, or mac computer that is
capable of running q3 and has both the full q3 version and the 1.27 or
more recent point release installed.

Bid For Power attempts to capture the feel of anime style ki fighting. 
  In the first release of BFP, 6 of the strongest fighters in the
universe enter the arena in a fight for domination.

## Features

-  6 different selectable characters, each with 5 attacks.

-  21 different ki attacks including controllable, homing, and
chargeable attacks (no guns).

-  Toggleable flight.

-  Offhand melee combat

-  Re-\"charge\"able ki energy for ammo, flight, and speed/power boost.

-  Power level determines the strength of attacks, speed of movement,
max health, max ki, ki charge rate, and what attacks are available.

-  5 different game modes: FFA, 1v1, Team DM, Last Man Standing Team DM,
and Giant Monkey mode.  

-  Numerous new player animations.

-  Head and full body transformations, selectable aura, ki trail,
scalable attacks, big explosions, playable third person mode, first
person vis mode.

## Installation

**Windows

-  Install the full retail version of Quake 3 Arena. The demo version
will NOT work with BFP.

-  Install the latest point release for Quake 3 Arena, found at http://www.quake3world.com/files

-  Run the bfpinstaller.exe program.

-  To start the game, use one of the two shortcuts created by the
installer.

#### Installation (linux or mac)

-  Install the full retail version of Quake 3 Arena. The demo version
will NOT work with BFP.

-  Install the latest point release for Quake 3 Arena, found at http://www.quake3world.com/files

-  Unzip the bfpr1.zip file into your quake 3 arena
directory. Make sure to use folder names when extracting the files. 
 

-  The directory \"bfp\" will be created as a subdirectory of the quake
3 directory.

-  To start the game, either use the \"Mods\" tab in quake 3, or start
the game with command line args "+set fs_game bfp".   

## How do I play a multi-player game?

This game is designed to be played multiplayer. From the main menu,
click on the \"multiplayer\" button. BFP will scan all of the quake 3
arena servers and display any BFP servers that it finds. Once a BFP
server is found, highlight it, click accept and the game will connect to
the server.

## Is there a single-player game?

Just barely. This game is intended to be played multi-player. A
single player game can be played with the bots, but we recommend playing
against real people.

## Viewpoint

Viewpoint is how you see the game while you play it. You have your
choice of 3 different viewpoints for playing BFP. To switch between
the views, use the BFP Options menu.

-  **Third Person:** The model is seen from the outside. Unlike the
standard quake 3 third person view, in BFP the crosshair is visible, and
the angle is changed to create less blocking of the view. Cvars
cg_thirdPersonAngle and cg_thirdPersonRange have had their cheat
protection removed, and cg_thirdPersonHeight was added for additional
customization.

-  **First Person Vis:** First person where your own model is drawn.   
Your viewpoint is positioned on the model\'s eyes, and you can see your
own arms and legs while fighting.

-  **First Person:** The standard first person quake 3 view.

### Power Level

Power level is how strong you are. Power level determines max health,
max ki, movement speed, damage caused by attacks, and which attacks are
available to use. The only way to get more power is to kill someone.   
When you die (in most game modes), your power level is reset to the
average of all current power levels. When the game ends or the server
restarts, the power level of the players is reset to the default.

## Power Tiers

Power level is divided into tiers. While most power level effects are
based on the power level itself, aura color and attacks available is
determined by the tier.

-  Tier 1: \< 100,000 PL. Blue aura, only one ki attack available.

-  Tier 2: 100,000 - 250,000 PL. Red aura, two ki attacks selectable.

-  Tier 3: 250,000 - 500,000 PL. Red aura, three ki attacks
selectable.

-  Tier 4: 500,000 - 999,000 PL. Red aura, four ki attacks
selectable.

-  Ultimate Tier: 1 mil PL. Yellow aura, all attacks selectable.

## Transformations

When a player\'s power level hits 1 million, the transformation
happens. The aura color turns yellow, and if the character has a
transformation it occurs. Other than the benefits from increased
power level, there is no additional benefit of the transformation.

## Ki Energy

Ki is your stamina. Ki is used as ammunition for the ki attacks.   
Additionally, ki can be used to increase power, speed, jumping height,
and special attacks by using the boost key. Ki can be charged in
order to replenish it at any time by holding down the charge key.   
Beware, while charging you can not move or attack, and are highly
visible to other players.

## Flight

BFP has a toggleable flight button. The default is \"f\" but it can
be set in the controls menu. To begin flying, simply press f once,
and once again to stop flying. While flying, you are able to move to
wherever you look. The jump key will make you move up, and the crouch
key will make you move down. Your ki drains at a steady rate. At
low power levels you will need to limit your flight, while at high power
levels you can fly all day. A large speed boost is gained by holding
down the boost key.

## Melee Combat

To engage in melee combat, hold down the melee key and put the
crosshairs over your opponent. If you are close range, then you will
start beating on him. If you are long range, you will dive at the bad
guy for a strike. To add extra knock back and stun your opponent,
hold down the boost key while melee fighting.

## Hit Stun

While in hit stun, the player can not move, attack, block, or charge.   
1 second of hit stun is added when the player runs out of ki. 3
seconds of hit stun is added when melee is used in combination with the
boost key. Do not overlook this feature. Being able to knock
people into hit stun with ki-boosted melee is one of the keys to being
good at BFP.

\*The melee stun can be avoided by holding melee while you are attacked.

\*Hit stun can be ended by teleporting after one second.

## Short-Range Teleport

BFP includes controlled short-range teleportation that is performed by
double-tapping right or left movement keys. If right or left is
tapped twice while moving forward, then the teleport moves in a diagnal
forward direction. Teleporting diagnally backward direction can be
done by moving backwards and then tapping left or right twice.   
Teleport is useful for dodging attacks, and can be used to break out of
hit stun after 1 second.

## Blocking

Pressing block once grants the player between one and two seconds of
blocking. Blocking drains ki quickly, but transfers all damage to ki
instead of health. Blocking can also be used to deflect missile
attacks. There is a one second delay between when the player stops
blocking and when the player can block again.

## Ki Attacks

Each character has 5 attacks. At the lowest power tier, the player
only has one selectable attack. Each time the player advances to a
new power tier, he gets a new selectable attack. By default, each of
the numeric keys, 1-5, choose a different attack. Only one attack can
be selected at a time, but switching between attacks is instant.

-  standard attacks: hold down fire and you fire.

-  charge-up attacks: hold down fire to start charging the attack,
release fire to fire.

-  minimum charge-up attacks: same as charge-up attacks, but with a
minimum charge-up time. The ball of ki will appear in the player\'s
hands once he is prepared to fire.

-  beam attacks: a type of charge-up attack. Can only fire one beam
at a time. After firing, you can aim the attack by moving the mouse,
or detonate it by hitting fire again.

-  homing attacks: these attacks will home in on the nearest opponent.

## Attack Collisions

Unlike quake 3 attacks, BFP attacks are more than just a trajectory.   
Attacks have actual dimensions, and will explode on contact with
players. If an attack looks 50' wide, it will hit any players who
come within 25' of the center of the attack. Mid-air attack
collisions also happen. Two attacks that collide will damage each
other, and the stronger attack will cause the other to explode. The
exception is any beam attack, which enters into a power struggle when
hitting another beam attack, and will explode any non-beam attack except
for the disk attacks and the deathball.

## Power Struggles

When two beam attacks collide, a power struggle will happen. Instead
of the stronger beam blowing up the weaker beam, the stronger beam will
push back the weaker beam until it hits the other player. Ki boost
can be used to up the power of your beam if you are losing a power
struggle. The Death Ball is an exception among the missile attacks,
and can be used in a power struggle.

## Custom Player Models

[A separate doc](Create_Custom_Models.md), explains how to create custom models for BFP.

## Troubleshooting

#### Help! My computer can't handle BFP!

With all of the graphics options turned on, BFP takes a much beefier
system than standard Quake 3. If your computer sucks, don't despair. We're looking out for you. BFP is meant to push a p3 500 with 128 megs
of memory and a GeForce video card, but it is designed to be able to run
playably on a celeron 300 with 128 megs of memory and a TNT1.   
However, with a much weaker system than that, you are pushing your luck
with BFP.   

Here are some things you can do to try to boost your performance.

-  The first thing to try is turning off dynamic lights in the game
options menu. Quake 3 can be slow when it comes to handling dynamic
lights, and there are a lot of them in BFP.

-  Go into the BFP options menu and use the ki trail slider bar to lower
the length of the ki trail. Few systems can handle the ki trail at
its max length without framerate loss. With the slider bar all the
way to the left, the ki trail will have 0 length. With the slider bar
all the way to the right, the ki trail will almost stretch the length of
our maps.

-  Go under the systems setting menu and lower the resolution to
640x480. Don't gag, most Quake 3 competition players seem to use this
resolution.

-  Go into the BFP options menu and set the aura type to "polygonal
aura". This is the least costly aura type. Using the BFP options
menu, turn transformation aura off, dynamic aura lights off, dynamic
explosion lights off, ki trail off, small own aura on, and ssj perma
glow off. With these settings BFP should run about as well as quake 3
does on your computer.

-  If you are really having trouble go into the video set-up menu and
change the lighting from lightmap to vertex. Everything will look
crappy, but the game will run faster.

-  If your system is running low on memory, use the BFP options menu to
turn Force Default Skins on. This is the BFP equivalent of
cg_forceModels in Quake 3. Force Default Skins will disable all
custom skins for the models. With this option on, there will only be
one skin shared between all Vegetas.

#### I'm using a Mac, and can't play.

-  open up the file *baseq3/q3config.cfg*.

-  find the line ***seta vm_cgame \"2\"***

-  change the \"2\" to a \"1\"

-  do the same for the file *bfpq3/q3config.cfg*.

#### All I can see is the back of my character\'s head.

-  delete the following 3 files: <br/>
- - baseq3/q3config.cfg
- - bfpq3/q3config.cfg
- - bfpq3/bfp.cfg

#### I can't connect to any servers and get a message about wrong protocol.

-  update your quake 3 to the 1.31 point release.

-  if you continue to have the problem then you are probably connecting to a server that uses an old point release.

#### I can't select any characters.

-  update your quake 3 to the 1.31 point release.

#### My third person view is all messed up and I can't fix it by using cg_thirdPersonRange and cg_thirdPersonHeight.

-  Go to the bfp options menu, and find the button labelled \"Fixed Third Person\", and turn it on.
