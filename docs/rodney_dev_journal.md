# Q3 models get ready to download - 11/13/2001 by Rodney	

my personal website is done, I haven't uploaded it yet, cuz Im trying to find someone to host it for a good deal, if you know of a good deals with unlimited bandwidth, or no charge for bandwidth that would be great. im shooting to get a host by this saturday, so expect the site up in about 2-3 weeks from now. The BFP models will not available yet, cuz of the new way the code is been implemented. So we have to wait til yrgol gives us the go =).
My site is gonna be at www.RodneyOlmos.com so you can try checking everynow and then and youll see junk poping in and out =).





 

# Let me rephrase this - 10/05/2001 by Rodney	

Im also looking at the possibilities of making all the characters I made capable of including multiple animations built on the models so if other people want to use them for their mods or anything else related they will also be able to add them to their mod or game using the characters I built, with my permission or requests to use them, and you may not alter them and claim them yours.




 

# Sound Help - 10/01/2001 by Rodney	

Thanx to all the people that emailed me and offered their help on sound. Im going to be emailing a list of things that "need to be done", the peeps that emailed me, so we can get this ball rolling and get all the characters over with.
We have enough people helping with sounds now=), so thats good. and I think that might be enough






 

# Characters for Quake arena done - 09/26/2001 by Rodney	

Hey all, I update like once every 6 months =)
things that are new are this.
- I just finished paking all the characters for quake3 arena, this includes all the phase 2 characters, the extra dbz characters like yamcha, the chibis, ussj trunsk,etc, and the new bfp characters. In gonna be releasing them fairly soon or as soon as I get all the sounds for each one of the characters, I would really like a hand on sounds, If you would like to help on that please email me at nameck@networld.com the quake3 characters will get released on sets of 5 characters at the time.

- New BFP characters are also getting paked for release, all the original DBZ phase 1 characters are pretty much done, and I will be releasing them a lil after BFP is released, it will be on paks of 6 characters at the time so you can add them to the new BFP.

- The other dbz characters will also get released soon after the first pak. like tien yamcha the chibis ussj trunks, gohan and stuff. but when they get released they will be using some one else's attack. example, chibi goten will use goku's attack and such, yamcha will may be use krillins.

Reasons for this is game balancing. so far there are 6 attack systems that yrgol coded and by adding new attacks for other characters might unbalance the game. hopefully after release we will get feedback from everybody on how the game plays so we can tweak it for balancing and may be adding more set of attacks for other characters, besides the dbz phase 2 needs to be tackled different since we are not gonna use dbz stuff any more.


Im also looking at the possibilities of making all the characters I made capable of including multiple animations built on the models so if other people want to use them for their mods or anything else related they will also be able to add them to their mod or game using the characters I built with my permission or request to use them..

for now thats it, Ill try to keep updating often til release.

lates all
