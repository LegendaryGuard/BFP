# Meteor - 12/16/2001 by PyroFragger

I spent a couple hours today helping dash with his new map by creating this meteor map object that rests in the crater.

It looks 10x as cool ingame.





 
# Hehe, i bet you thought i forgot:) - 12/13/2001 by PyroFragger


Trying to be a little more faithful to my promises, spent the last 4 hours working on this:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49716252/225170779-f77e1352-9bd1-45da-bc28-5fa862b3e23d.jpg" alt="TetRender" width=640 />

Excuse the slow load times of the bfp server. This is Tetsedah, one of the bfp character drawing contest winners. I sat down and reconstructed the mesh using my basemodel instead of Rodney's. Here's a picture of the sketch that Jeff aka Dark Cloud drew:

Also, that awkward shadow on the collar of the jacket is just a rendering artifact, no idea what causes this but it's not part of the model so don't worry.




 
# Arggg - 12/12/2001 by PyroFragger


My computer crashed and i lost some tweaking work i had done to the model. Not a problem, but i have to postpone the shots till tomorrow. Hopefully this won't happen once i have more RAM. Home stretch:) I aim to have both of the models ingame with temporary solid color skins by the end of this weekend, hopefully the skins will be done really soon.
/me hands Ansel more gatorade

Go Go Go!





 
# Go baby Go - 12/12/2001 by PyroFragger


I can have Ryuujin INGAME the day after i get the skin from Ansel. In the mean time, i work on the second model. It\'s close to done, i\'ll show it off later tonight around 10 oclock pm EST. The finish line is in sight, cheer ansel on!
/me hands Ansel a gatorade





 

# Ryuujin Model Finished - 12/04/2001 by PyroFragger


Finished all the stuff i need to do for Ryuujin and last weekend sent the maps to Ansel for skinning. Here's a pic:

It was gonna be in the monday update but there was no monday update so i'm posting it here.





 

# Information - 11/22/2001 by PyroFragger	


This isn't an eyecandy update, just an informational one. As yrgol said, we can release BFP around a week after he has all the models completed. I have ryuujin completed and ready to go ingame as soon as i get a skin from ansel (who's on vacation at the moment) and will have my second character completed sometime next week after i get another concept from ansel. By that time Pyrate will most likely be ingame, so we should be seeing a release very shortly. In my next update i'll have snazzy posed renders of Ryuujin and Komasurao, not saying when though because there's too much that can happen that can delay a date.




 

# Ryuujin Coming Soon - 11/17/2001 by PyroFragger	


Sometime this week i'll have pictures of Ryuujin for you guys. The model is done and uv mapped, but i have to redo much of the physiquing and ansel still has to skin it. You'll see skinned renders in here soon as well as ingame shots on the mainpage.




 

# BaseModel Version 2.0 - 11/13/2001 by PyroFragger	


For those who care, i reuploaded the BaseModel zip with fixed weighting on the ass. It was collapsing during some of the animations, fixed that right up. Version 2.0, same link as below.
Also, the biped is HIDDEN, not missing. Just go to the fifth tab and unhide all.





 

# The Basemodel - 11/12/2001 by PyroFragger	

Here it is. It's fully UV Mapped and Physiqued , with all the tags correctly parented to the biped. For those of you without MAX, there is also the 3ds version that is simply uv mapped, you'll have to attach it to a skeleton in whatever program you use and parent the tags aswell. The uv mapping is done in such a way that all you need is ONE texture for the entire upper and lower body. The head has its own mapping (the head mapping is very very messy but it gets the job done, fix it if you feel like it). I recommend 1 128x128 texture for the head and a 512x512 for the body.
*!*!* UPDATE *!*!*!*! I've ported it to MAX 4. If you've downloaded it already and use MAX4, redownload now!

Download It Here (broken link): https://web.archive.org/web/20011218203246/http://www.bidforpower.com/Pyro/BaseModel.zip

Enjoy. Remember, ALL that i ask is for a little credit, and please, if you're going to edit it, edit it enough that its a new character, don't just change his hair to give him a mohawk and release it. I want to see quality character models made from this.

EDIT: Also, if (for whatever reason) you've seen any bfp skins at all, you'll notice that the uv mapping is set up in the same way as Rodney's. Again, this is NOT Rodney's basemodel, you can check the uv wireframes as well as the actual geometry yourself if you're skeptical.





 

# Homestead blows - 11/10/2001 by PyroFragger	


Seems every time i use homestead to show pictures to you guys i exceed my monthly bandwidth in only one day, lol. If anyone has another free hosting site that allows img tagging (i.e. NOT GEOCITIES!), tell me.




 

# BAMMMMMMMMMM! - 11/09/2001 by PyroFragger	


Heh, if you live in another timezone, sue me, its still 11 oclock over here. I still have some work to do on the model but i figure i'll show you what i have today. This is about 6 and a half hours worth of work:

(old lost image: https://web.archive.org/web/20011218203246im_/http://alieninstinct.homestead.com/files/Base1.jpg)

(old lost image: https://web.archive.org/web/20011218203246im_/http://alieninstinct.homestead.com/files/Base2.jpg)

(old lost image: https://web.archive.org/web/20011218203246im_/http://alieninstinct.homestead.com/files/Base4.jpg)

This isn't really Komosurao, just threw his head on the basemodel i'll be releasing later on (most likely tomorrow, i spent more time on the model than i thought i would, but it payed off). The more experienced MAX users on the editing forum should find this useful as either a guide or as a base for their own models. Enjoy.






 

# On Track - 11/08/2001 by PyroFragger	


All's in order for tomorrow, tomorrow i will be releasing the following to the budding designers in our community:
A MAX file containing my new basemodel i am using to create my bfp characters. The model will be uv mapped and physiqued to a standard bfp skeleton

A copy of the bfp animation list and an explanation for all of them

I'll also have pics of my actual bfp models.





 

# Friday Update - 11/06/2001 by PyroFragger	

Thank God i'm through with all this work, i'm home free for a bit. Look for an update friday with new stuff.




 

# Info - 11/01/2001 by PyroFragger	

I don't really spend much time here anymore obviously, mostly because schoolwork this year really picked up. As it stands, i have two exams tomorrow, and two large reports due tuesday and wednesday, followed by some more exams. I'd say after next week, i'll be in the clear for a bit, but until then its tough to say how much i'll be able to do. I MAY be able to squeeze a couple hours of work into Saturday. What i've decided to do is make my own base model for all my characters. Until now, i'd been using Rodney's because it had been determined that the new bfp would just be different skins and head models on the same body. Well we've obviously strayed away from that to give the finished product more variety, so i'd like to make my own basemodel instead of simply just edit other people's work. The same head models will stay though, since those are mine. Once my basemodel is done i'll be able to more easily invent new characters off of it, and i will release the finished, uvmapped, and physiqued basemodel to developers in the community in the form of a bfpsdk to base their own custom bfp models on, provided that in the readme you mention the basemodel came from me.
Most of you have probably already read yrgol's dev journal. That's exactly what i'll be doing with all of my custom models in the future. As he said, there's no way it will be in the first release (which is why i'll only be releasing one of my models for the first release), but eventually all models will have visually different attacks and auras.

Here's some information on the characters that will eventually be in a future release of bfp:

Komasurao - Decided to make him evil. He has a very dark, cruel energy. He's a very deceptive and ingenious fighter, he can trick other fighters with illusions and his attacks pack a punch.

Ryuujin - Stands for Dragon God in japanese. He is, obviously, a god who has spent the past 3 millenia training his mind and his body. He rarely speaks, and is rarely seen, but he always shows up when there is trouble. His ki is "different," kind of mysterious and very powerful. He wields two scerpent-dragon swords whose blades are made of the same ki as a kienzan.

Tetsedha - A very determined and confident, but not overconfident, fighter. He lives for the fight and trains continously. His ki is very cold and his attacks are slower than those of Taipan. He takes fighting very seriously and is easily a match for anyone.

Taipan - A very aggressive, firey fighter who is easily ticked off and a force to be reckoned with. He is the rival of Tetsedha, and also lives for the fight. The only thing that keeps him going is the continous struggle to become better than him. This competition has made him a very talented and dangerous fighter. His ki is very firey and his attacks are quick.

Drexx - As a teenager, he was very violent and irritable, so he was taken in by a master to try and turn his anger and rage into controllable energy. After 18 years of training, he has become one of the most elite fighters in the universe. He possesses a very electric ki, and he is scared of no one.

Obviously i'm not the most reliable person in the world right now, so i can't make a prediction on when these will all be done, but i can they'll be done soon. I'll try and squeeze in time here and there inbetween working sessions.





 

# ........ - 10/20/2001 by PyroFragger	


Well i'm getting over this motivational slump i've been in for the past month. A lot of things been going on where i just either couldn't find the time for BFP, or just didn't feel like working on it. For those that have seen office space, you know what im talking about. There was about a 3 week period where i just didn't care. Anyways, i figure its best to just knock this out and get it over with.




 

# Stay away from teh light!!!111111 - 10/12/2001 by PyroFragger	


Lol...............
The long story is: I was drinking my tea and eating my crumpets when gooey purple aliens teleported into my room. I was like, WTF? and they said: "Come with us, we will teach you many alien bondage techniques." I forget how it ends.

The short story is: I lost my homestead account and was too tired to reg a new account.





 

# LOL - 10/11/2001 by PyroFragger	


Heh, got so busy yesterday completely forgot about yesterday's update. Anyways, later tonight, unless i forget again (j/k, i wont).




 

# BOOJAH! - 10/08/2001 by PyroFragger	


K, im going to show you EVERYTHING ive done so far on wednesday. Unfortunately the contest winners and another 2 models i had going will not go into the initial release of BFP, i'm only allowed to have 1 go in as of now, due to the attack system. However, they will become available in a release sometime after the first release, sorry about that, but its out of my hands. So it'll either by the one i've already pimped on the forums or another model i made that you haven't seen yet, but none of the contest entries will go into the first release, not fair to the other winners. Anyways, check back on wednesday, i'll have some cool stuff.




 

# Yadda Yadda Yadda - 09/22/2001 by PyroFragger	


No pics yet, sorry about that but if you've been following this project long enough you're probably used to it:) Anyways, other things have been occupying my time lately and i just haven't had much time/energy to sit there and work on the bfp models. We do have a deadline though, although i cant say what that is, and we are working towards it so the light at the end of the tunnel is within reach. Whenever i have pics ill show em here, not gonna say when because i dont like breaking promises and it'll be cooler as a surprise.
-P





 

# New Characters, Sneak Peek - 09/14/2001 by PyroFragger	


These aren't finished, but i'm a little too burned out right now to continue modeling tonight, so for now you can see the bodies of the two male winners of the drawing contest. Tomorrow, i'll have the female winner as well as all three head models on, and sometime this upcoming week i'll have snazzy new renders of these three and 2 others of my own creation:) K, nuff stalling:

# The Winners!!!! - 09/07/2001 by PyroFragger	

Finally, I have sifted through all the contest winners, and here they are. First of all, let me thank everyone who set time aside for this contest. As an artist myself i know sometimes when you enter contests and don't win, it can be depressing, but I saw a lot of impressive drawings in that thread, a lot of you guys have a lot of talent, so keep at it.

Those were the drawings that I felt, after sifting through all 28 pages of the thread, would be the best concept art to base models on. I made this first cut basically by how well thought out the drawing was. I tried to avoid typical drawings, such as characters in ordinary gi's, with ordinary face and ordinary everything else.

Now, from this list, I narrowed it down even further to a list of 5 males and 5 females. Those are........

- Taipan
- UF's Friend Entry 2
- Nomas
- Wylder
- Adult Chibi

- Lee
- Ree
- Reinako
- Aenea
- Sakana

I made these lists by basically picking out the drawings that best conformed to the style of BFP. If this had been an art contest, MutilatedPuppet would have won by far, his pen style artwork is incredible. Had this been a CG contest, Zone would have won by far with his awesome solid-color shading technique. Unfortunately though, neither of these fit the style of BFP, and several others like it also fell through at this point. Great drawings none the less.

Now, on to the grading.

Originality - Does this drawing borrow bits and pieces from dbz characters, or other anime characters, or is it unique?

- Taipan - 9 (Boots like trunks)
- UF's Friend Entry 2 - 10
- Nomas - 10
- Wylder - 10
- Adult Chibi - 8 (Piccolo's entire cape look)

- Lee - 10
- Ree - 10
- Reinako - 10
- Aenea - 8 (saiyan pads and boots)
- Sakana - 10

Not too much of a problem here, all pretty much original drawings for the most part.

Design - Is the general design of the character executed well or is it plain?

- Taipan - 10
- UF's Friend Entry 2 - 10
- Nomas - 9
- Wylder - 9
- Adult Chibi - 8

- Lee - 9
- Ree - 10
- Reinako - 9
- Aenea - 8
- Sakana - 10

Style - Does the character fit into the BFP/DBZ universe, or generally speaking, does it look good performing ki attacks and flying.

- Taipan - 10
- UF's Friend Entry 2 - 10
- Nomas - 10
- Wylder - 10
- Adult Chibi - 10

- Lee - 7
- Ree - 7
- Reinako - 7
- Aenea - 9
- Sakana - 10

Effort - Is it evident that the person spent a lot of time on this drawing, or does it appear rushed.

- Taipan - 10
- UF's Friend Entry 2 - 10
- Nomas - 9
- Wylder - 10
- Adult Chibi - 9

- Lee - 9
- Ree - 10
- Reinako - 10
- Aenea - 9
- Sakana - 9

EXTRA CREDIT - Not necessary, but rather a point extra added to the score for each thing i notice that grabs my eye about the drawing.

- Taipan - Excellent work on the CG, +1
- UF's Friend Entry 2 -
- Nomas
- Wylder
- Adult Chibi - Nice CG, +1

- Lee -
- Ree -
- Reinako - +1 for excellent CG work
- Aenea - Beautiful style, color +2
- Sakana - Nice job with extra attack drawings, plus CG +2

FINAL SCORE

- Taipan - 40
- UF's Friend Entry 2 - 40
- Nomas - 38
- Wylder - 39
- Adult Chibi - 36

- Lee - 35
- Ree - 37
- Reinako - 37
- Aenea - 36
- Sakana - 41

Now, since there is a tie in the male section, what i've decided to do is model BOTH, since each are extremely strong character designs and it'd be a waste to choose one over the other. That makes our winners Taipan, Unnamed(UF's friends entry 2), and Sakana. I will contact the winners tomorrow (a little late to do it tonight, dont you think, heh) and we'll work together to make the character like they envisioned it. Again, thanks to all who entered, it was a great contest and just because you didn't get picked is no reason to feel bad about your art, the only drawback of contests is there can only be so many winners. G'nite.

# Komasurao - 09/04/2001 by PyroFragger	

Click Here: https://web.archive.org/web/20020106152249/http://alieninstinct.homestead.com/files/Komasurao.jpg
Its my first serious attempt at skinning an organic model. Hopefully i did ok. It doesn't have a face yet, yes i know, and the skin still needs touchups but atleast you can see what the character itself will look like. Give me suggestions. Komasurao is a combination of "ko"(great) and "masurao"(warrior). Im thinking of putting a japanese symbol on the back of his cape.

BTW, im gonna send it to rodney so he can render it out like the others and make a character sheet for it, this is just a temporary render.





 

# New Character Delay - 09/03/2001 by PyroFragger	


K, i do have them done, but they are still being worked on and I refuse to rush them. Tomorrow I'll have atleast one finished, SKINNED model rendered in the style as the others. Drawings look good btw, keep it up. Remember, you have till friday.




 

# BFP Character Drawing Contest - 09/02/2001 by PyroFragger	

I'm sure most of you have seen this by now but if you haven't, for all you artistically inclined people, there's a drawing contest to determine the look of one new bfp character. Details can be found HERE: https://web.archive.org/web/20011031125532/http://www.thejasper.com/DBZ/CosDBZ.html
Good luck.

PS: HUMAN/SAIYAN!!! IF YOUR CHARACTER IS NOT HUMAN/SAIYAN IT WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED!! NUFF SAID.





 

# Take me, I'm yours. - 06/06/2001 by PyroFragger	

It's been decided, the music video will be a long one involving all characters, transitions between each, and a short intro at the beginning. The reason for these videos is to show off all 5 attacks for each characters, as well as melee action and the latest effects, animated, to some of your favorite tunes, not only because we are bored and need something to stall with while we keep pressing for release:) Look for these in the next week (still editing them to fit the music).
As of now, remisser (the music composer, for those that don't know) is finishing some ingame music and it is coming along really well. He'll have his own journal with the new layout, but for right now, he's sharing mine. Expect more from him soon.

# I stubbed my toenail and now it smells like monkey... - 05/20/2001 by PyroFragger	

I've been talking with a composer over the past couple of days and he is gonna do some music for bfp. I may be using some music from him to do some of the music videos. You can expect all of the music videos with our new layout, which will be coming soon. Thanks for your patience.
P.S. If you get bored or tired of waiting, go to www.newgrounds.com:)





 

# The little engine that can - 05/09/2001 by PyroFragger	

I know its been awhile since you've seen an update with new material, but thats only because we are spending more time trying to get this out to you guys. After a long standstill, we are finally getting moving again and BFP will be out before you know it. All we ask for is a little more patience. As for the music videos, I got 185 emails from fans requesting songs. Obviously i couldnt look at them all so Im going to weed through the topics and find the most popular songs for each character. If you want to get your voice in, I suggest replying in one of those topics in the next 30 mins. Later.




 

# Look honey he plays hockey - 05/03/2001 by PyroFragger	

I just wanted to say this cause no one else is. A lot of people are probably frustrated that we haven't released yet. Well we are definately more anxious to release than any of you are. I can't go into details, but you have to believe that we are doing everything we can to get this out as soon as we can. Bare with us for a little bit. There are things preventing the release that cannot be publicly announced, but we are ready when it gets cleared up.
Anyways, I may do some music videos or something promotional featuring all the characters, all 5 of their attacks, and a transformation. I was going to do this before, but never got around to it. Any song requests for certain people. Krillin automatically gets "Smack my Bitch Up" by prodigy, so thats not an opetion:) But I need song ideas for the rest.





 

# ...Ick, no pooh title for this one... - 04/27/2001 by PyroFragger	

My internet went down yesterday. Im on a cable modem, so when they work on the servers, my internet is running at 14,4 baud modem speed at best. Its awful. Well right after i said they would be up and that i still had time on the forums, the cable stopped working. I ran the test on the modem and the cable light was out. Now homestead wont let me on because they are upgrading the server or something, so until then, they arent up. I did have them done yesterday, I swear:) Anyways, hopefully later today i can get into my homestead account. For your information they are pics of Majin Dabura and Chibi Pan.

This has nothing to do with BFP at all (except for the little blurb at the bottom) but I took the time to learn MAX modeling over the past couple of days. All high poly stuff, but the princliple of making the initial mesh is still low poly, so I may transcend from Raydream to MAX, I just hope it improves my quality. Here's the thing i made, anyways. My first mesh completely modeled in MAX:)


BFP:
Im gonna go against what I said last time just this once so that you can look forward to the part 2 model selection on Thursday.

# ...and Tigger, and little Roo..... - 04/14/2001 by PyroFragger	

*BIG* update:
First, I just want to say that the gi versions of Krillin and Gohan will not be part of the main download on account of some problems I was having with MAX (totally corrupted the file). They will be released later on as an addon. Im incredibly tired of physiquing and animating so today I took a break from all of that. Here is the result:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49716252/225171714-04529531-5380-4f37-81c2-0850284f2fd3.jpg" alt="checkthisout" width=640 />

Hope that tides you over for a while. I also want to say that I am no longer giving out public release dates because things tend to happen that are not in my favor, and I always end up with a lot of disgruntled people on my case.

You can expect more models sometime soon, but like i said, im not going to say when:)

As for why I'm working on models that fit in phase 3, it is because most of our phase 2 models are done and I was just pretty bored and tired of animating. Now I have them done, and don't have to worry about them when the time comes.

# ...A donkey named Eyore is his friend... - 04/12/2001 by PyroFragger	

Good things and bad things.
Good: I found an easy way around the deformation problems the two models have been having so I can finally get them working right. As of now, they deform like hell, but that will all be fixed. If all goes well, I will have in-game shots of them tomorrow.

Bad: I have put my website on hiatus so those bitching about it will have to chill. Things come up, I'll finish it when I have nothing at all to work on. In the mean time, you can read other tutorials, but mine's gonna take longer than I thought because I have to give the same steps for two different modeling packages, so it takes twice as long. Check back Saturday for a status report, I *may* be finished the tut by then, but don't hold me to that (and you wonder why we don't give release dates when we don't know if we can keep them:) I have other stuff to show off too on Saturday. Peace.

# ...For most of his childhood days... - 04/05/2001 by PyroFragger	

Check for the skins in Ansel's journal in the next few minutes. I gotta roll out, so I dont have time to upload a shot. The torso is going to be seperated from the legs because i dont have tags on them yet. Tomorrow I can work the kinks out and maybe have an ingame screen for each of them.

# ..There lies an enchanted neighborhood - 04/03/2001 by PyroFragger	

I will be finished with everything relating to phase 1 by tomorrow, so my site will be finished soon. I had hoped to finish it much sooner but such is life. Check for screenshots either tomorrow or thursday of them skinned.




 

# ...where Christopher Robin plays... - 03/27/2001 by PyroFragger	

Those expecting the tutorial will have to wait. BFP work comes first, tut comes second. If you didnt already know we are finishing things and I have to of course get my models done really soon. They are already attached to skeletons and are animated, in the process of getting skinned, so they will be done soon. I may have the tut up by this weekend. Ive got more work to show later, not for phase 1.

# Deep in the hundred acre woods..... - 03/16/2001 by PyroFragger	

Applied BFP standard animations and attack animations to the new krillin and gohan, ready for skinning soon. Also, I am designing a website for myself that will include shots of m bfp work and my first ever modeling tutorial that is nearing completion.

# New Krillin and Gohan - 02/24/2001 by PyroFragger	

Two reasons for this:
1) tired of everyone telling me to change their outfits to Gi's (Your post clenched it Mr. Krillin ;)

2) wasnt happy with the level of quality of the models compared to my newer models

So......here they are, unskinned:

Krillin: 790 polygons
Gohan: 892 polygons

# Random Updates - 02/09/2001 by PyroFragger	

Been working on Cell perfect a tad bit more to get it ready for Roney's skin job. Cell form 1 is next. I also may be making a RoQ movie file for the ending of BFTP. Lastly, I've been working on a 32 person tourney/capture the dragonballs map. Until phase 2 is released, itll just be a big tourney map. Screenshots of that as well soon. Thats about it, later.




 

# One more update from me today - 02/09/2001 by PyroFragger	

As I said, I've been working on cell. This is the result, a more stylized, sleek, and muscular Cell:

# First Update - 12/17/2000 by PyroFragger	

My first dev journal on the new site. As of now, im tweaking Gohan and Krillin while the others finish up. Work continues on Cell as well:

(old lost image: https://web.archive.org/web/20011218203246im_/http://pyrofragger.homestead.com/files/p_cell.jpg)

Anyways, i dont have much to do right now for phase 1, so I will probably be starting some giant tourney maps due to the 1.27 patch.
