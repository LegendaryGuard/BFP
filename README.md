### History

Started: 1999 <br/> 
Ended: 2002

Bid For Power is a total conversion for QuakeIII that plays nothing like the original game. Players take control of Ki-powered superheros and battle it out in a mostly aerial fight. The game is highlighted by the work of a great art team and an original style, and the gameplay is extremely fast paced. It can be difficult to keep up with until you get the hang of it.

The source code was lost, but the assets and some docs are in any place.


### About the repository

We're doing a recreation of the lost source code. <br/>
The highest priority goal is to completely copy BFP game logical structure. <br/>
Any fixes, improvements and contributions are welcome. But we still can't accept secondary things until it's completely finished and becomes stable.

- Old documentations:

- - [Guide](Guide.md)

- - [Creating custom plugin models](Create_Custom_Models.md)

# Compilation and installation
