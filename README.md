### History

![BFP_ZEQ2_history](https://github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com/49716252/267147557-7954d397-3df4-4cf7-b9c3-d62e393658ab.png)

Started: 1999 <br/> 
Ended: 2002

Bid For Power is a total conversion for QuakeIII that plays nothing like the original game. Players take control of Ki-powered superheros and battle it out in a mostly aerial fight. The game is highlighted by the work of a great art team and an original style, and the gameplay is extremely fast paced. It can be difficult to keep up with until you get the hang of it.

The source code was lost, but the assets and some docs are in any place.

### About the repository

We're making a replica of the lost source code. <br/>
The highest priority goal is to copy and recreate the complete logical structure of the BFP game. It would be a game SDK that'll provide a structured and standardized way to modify the mod.<br/>
Any fixes, improvements and contributions are welcome. But we can't accept secondary things and other stuff that don't reach the goals.

### References and clues to know how should be the game

Documentations, references and extracted stuff will give us clues to reach the goals. <br/>

- Old documentations:

    * [Guide](docs/Guide.md)
    * [Creating custom plugin models](docs/Create_Custom_Models.md)

<br/>

- Cvars, cmd and bind stuff about the old game:

    * [Bindlist](docs/bind_bfp_list.txt)
    * [Cmdlist](docs/cmd_bfp_list.txt)
    * [Cvarlist](docs/cvar_bfp_list.txt)

We can see a cvar, e.g. `g_plKillBonusPct`, which means we need to find the function that rewards the player and do something with that. Something like this:

```c
if ( killedSomeone ) {
   pl = currentPL + (currentPL * g_plKillBonusPct.value);
}
```

<br/>

   * [q3config.cfg](cfgs/q3config.cfg)


### How to build

#### Introduction

*IMPORTANT NOTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT*: all source code files should be **UTF-8 without BOM** and **Unix (LF)**, otherwise, it will cause compiler errors when using MakefileQVM (most likely, syntax error will be displayed).

- `.map` file is a linker map file, which is generated by the linker when it links together multiple object files into an executable or shared library. It contains information about the symbols (such as functions and variables) defined in each object file, as well as their addresses in the final executable or library.
The information in the map file can be useful for debugging and performance analysis. For example, it can help you identify which functions are taking the most time to execute, or which functions are being called from which parts of the code.

- The external JTS (Jump Target Segment) (`.jts`) files are used to improve the bytecode generation in the Quake 3 engine. The JTS file contains information about jump targets that are used by the VM (Virtual Machine) to execute the bytecode. It helps to avoid bugs, improve performance and it can be beneficial for better stability. JTS files are obtained compiling from q3asm, which can generate 1.32c-compatible QVMs along with the external JTS file.

- ### Windows:

    * #### _Building QVM (using .bat)_: 

    1. Keep in mind you must be in the repository directory. Execute `build.bat` to compile qvms.

    2. Once compiled successfully, look for `pak9.pk3`, copy and paste into `baseq3/` or mod Q3 game directory.

    Alternatively, in `build.bat`, you can set `NO_MAP=0` to obtain .map files, you can see them in binaries and intermediate directories.

    You can set `NO_JTS=1`, if you don't want to obtain .jts files inside pk3 file.

    * #### _Building QVM (mingw)_: 

    Note: that also uses 7z tool to compress them in a pk3 file.

    1. If you're using MSYS2 and you didn't install the prerequisites, follow the steps (from step 1 to step 4) on [MSYS2 (mingw)](#msys2-mingw-building-dynamic-libraries-dll) section.

    If you're using Cygwin and you didn't install the prerequisites, follow the steps (from step 1 to step 2) on [Cygwin (mingw)](#cygwin-mingw-building-dynamic-libraries-dll) section.

    2. Keep in mind you must be in the repository directory. To compile qvms, execute:
    ```sh
    make -f MakefileQVM
    ```

    3. Once compiled successfully, look for `pak9.pk3`, copy and paste into `baseq3/` or mod Q3 game directory. You can look `vm/` where you can see the objects and compiled files.

    Alternatively, you can execute:
    ```sh
    make -f MakefileQVM NO_JTS=1
    ```
    If you don't want to obtain .jts files inside pk3 file.

    Clean the compiled objects with:
    ```sh
    make -f MakefileQVM clean
    ```

    * #### _MSYS2 (mingw) (Building dynamic libraries (.dll))_:

    IMPORTANT NOTE: Not tested on Windows 32-bit. MSYS2 comes with multilib disabled in gcc (means you can't compile for x86 in a 64-bit system), more info [here](https://sourceforge.net/p/msys2/discussion/general/thread/3941f2c9/).


    To build, follow these instructions:

    1. Install msys2 from https://msys2.github.io/, following the instructions there.It doesnâ€™t matter which version you download, just get one appropriate for your OS.

    2. Start "MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit" from the Start Menu. If you're using 32-bit system, use "MSYS2 MinGW 32-bit".

    3. Install mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc:
    ```sh
    pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc
    ```
    32-bit:
    ```sh
    pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-gcc
    ```
    4. Install make:
    ```sh
    pacman -S make
    ```

    5. Go to the directory where you cloned the repository and compile with make
    ```sh
    make ARCH=x86_64
    ```
    32-bit:
    ```sh
    make ARCH=x86 WINDRES="windres -F pe-i386"
    ```

    6. Find the dlls in `build/release-mingw64-x86_64`, for 32-bit: `build/release-mingw32-x86`. <br/>
    
    If you can't compile 32-bit builds with MSYS2 MinGW, try [Cygwin](#cygwin-mingw-building-dynamic-libraries-dll) section.<br/>

    * #### _Cygwin (mingw) (Building dynamic libraries (.dll))_: 

    Detailed guide based on a [post by MAN-AT-ARMS](https://discourse.ioquake.org/t/how-to-build-ioquake3-using-cygwin/223).

    1. Install Cygwin

    Download the Cygwin setup package from http://cygwin.com/install.html.

    Choose either the 32-bit or 64-bit environment. 32-bit will work fine on both 32 and 64 bit versions of Windows. The setup program is also your Cygwin environment updater. If you have an existing Cygwin environment, the setup program will, by default, update your existing packages.

    Choose where you want to install Cygwin. The entire environment is self-contained in it's own folder, but you can also interact with files from outside the environment if you want to as well. The default install path is `C:\Cygwin`.
    Choose a mirror to download packages from, such as the [kernel.org](https://kernel.org/) mirrors.
    Choose a "storage area" for your package downloads.

    2. Package selection

    The next screen you see will be the package selections screen. In the upper left is a search box. This is where you will want to search for the necessary packages.

    These are the package names you'll want to search for:

    1- `mingw64-i686-gcc-core` (For building 32bit binaries)<br/>
    2- `mingw64-i686-gcc-g++` (Also for 32bit... C++ support... not required for the game, but useful for compiling other software)<br/>
    3- `mingw64-x86_64-gcc-core` (For building 64bit binaries)<br/>
    4- `mingw64-x86_64-gcc-g++` (For 64bit, same as above)<br/>
    5- `make`<br/>
    6- `bison`<br/>
    7- `git`

    3. Open Cygwin, go to the directory where you cloned the repository and compile with `make`

- ### Linux:

    * #### _Building QVM (make)_: 

    Note: that uses 7z tool to compress them in a pk3 file. If you don't have 7z tool, install with:
    ```sh
    sudo apt-get install p7zip-full
    ```

    1. If you didn't install the prerequisites, follow the step 1 on [Building shared libraries (.so)](#building-shared-libraries-so).

    2. Keep in mind you must be in the repository directory. To compile qvms, execute:
    ```sh
    make -f MakefileQVM
    ```

    3. Once compiled successfully, look for `pak9.pk3`, copy and paste into `baseq3/` or mod Q3 game directory. You can look `vm/` where you can see the objects and compiled files.

    Alternatively, you can execute:
    ```sh
    make -f MakefileQVM NO_JTS=1
    ```
    If you don't want to obtain .jts files inside pk3 file.
    
    Clean the compiled objects with:
    ```sh
    make -f MakefileQVM clean
    ```

    * #### _Building QVM (using .bat)_: 

    1. The alternative to execute and get the compiled qvms with `build.bat` requires [`wine` package](https://www.winehq.org/). So, in that part, needs the i386 package:
    ```sh
    sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386 && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install wine32-development
    ```
    But it could be executed without using 32-bit package, if your system supports 64-bits. Go to WineHQ page anyways.
    
    2. Keep in mind, you must be in the repository directory to execute the script:
    ```sh
    wine cmd /c build.bat
    ```

    3. Once compiled successfully, look for `pak9.pk3`, copy and paste into `baseq3/` or mod Q3 game directory.

    * #### _Building shared libraries (.so)_:
    
    1. If you don't have gcc tools, install the build-essential packages, which is also known as a meta-package, it contains the GCC compiler all the other essentials used to compile the software written in C and C++ language.
    Also, requires `libc6-dev-i386` for x86 builds and `g++-multilib` and `gcc-mingw-w64` for cross-compiling. More info about MinGW question in Linux [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44389963/how-to-install-mingw32-on-ubuntu).
    ```sh
    sudo apt-get install build-essential libc6-dev-i386 g++-multilib gcc-mingw-w64
    ```

    2. Simply execute (`-j4` is the number of parallel jobs you want to run during the compilation, in that case is set to 4): 
    ```sh
    make -j4
    ```
    3. And find .so files in `build/release-linux-x86_64`, for 32-bit: `build/release-linux-x86`. <br/><br/>


- ### Optional:

    You can use the optional part, if you followed and used some of these sections: 
    - [MSYS2 (mingw) (Building dynamic libraries (.dll))](#msys2-mingw-building-dynamic-libraries-dll)
    - [Cygwin (mingw) (Building dynamic libraries (.dll))](#cygwin-mingw-building-dynamic-libraries-dll)
    - [Building shared libraries (.so)](#building-shared-libraries-so)
    
    You can execute optionally the parameters using the following ways:

    * To compile debug x86 .so builds:
    ```sh
    make debug ARCH=x86 PLATFORM=linux # compiles debug x86 .so builds (creates "debug-linux-x86" directory inside "build")
    ```

    * To compile release x86 .dll builds:
    ```sh
    make ARCH=x86 PLATFORM=windows # compiles release x86 .dll builds (creates "release-windows-x86" directory inside "build")
    ```

    ... Optionally, you can play the parameters like `ARCH=x86_64` (compiles 64-bits builds), `PLATFORM=windows` (compiles dlls), `PLATFORM=linux` (compiles shared libraries (.so files)) ...

<br/>

#### Bid For Power name

Nobody owns the "Bid For Power" name. Bid For Power was founded by Chris James and likely ended up in the palm of Yrgol's hand (although Yrgol doesn't own the assets). The owner, the maintainer and the contributors of the repository don't own this name. <br/>
This does not give any single person or a group of people to sell the name, basically it belongs to the original community. <br/>
The Bid For Power team may provide sufficient security against any claims or improper use of the name.
