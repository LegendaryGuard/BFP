Welcome to the Quake 3 source code!
===============================

This is a fork of the official Quake-III-Arena repository.

The repository is created mostly for educational purposes and is not an attempt
to provide 'better Quake3 codebase'. Some features were removed (old GPUs,
non-windows platform code) in order to provide more simple codebase for 
experiments. Only Windows platform is supported.

Some of the modifications that were made to the original codebase:

1. Removed support for ancient graphics hardware and drivers.
1. Removed Unix and Mac OS X platform files. 
1. Visual Studio project files are updated to target Visual Studio 2013.
